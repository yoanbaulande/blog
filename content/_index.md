Hi, I'm Yoan.

Currently, I am in my final year of my Master's degree in MIAGE (*Master of Business Informatics*) at the University of Orl√©ans, France. I'm also working on a project involving Ansible and virtualization at a company.

I'm focused on developing my technical expertise across different technologies. I share my learning process and personal projects through my blog. Feel free to explore this website!
